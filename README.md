## What and why?

Einstein is a mobile friendly web application that optimizes the average NYU student experience combining systems such as Albert, Brightspace, and social applications like Campuswire and Ed Discussion.Â 

A student may need to check Albert for grades, Brightspace for assignments, and Campuswire for class discussions, all in the span of five minutes. This constant switching makes it easy to miss deadlines or announcements. We want to eliminate the widespread frustrations that we and our classmates experience when searching for course information, personal academic data, and communication channels with professors and students. Browsing through multiple disconnected platforms to access information for one class creates unnecessary load and managing all of these systems is inefficient and overwhelming.

## For whom?

The platform is designed with a primary focus on students. Students can GET deadline reminders, track their academic progress, and participate in class discussions. Professors and academic advisors can also benefit from this platform, where they can gain a full overview of student engagement and performance - tracking academic credits and posting assignments.

## How?

Instead of switching between Albert, Brightspace, and discussion platforms, Einstein brings all the important functionalities together in a modernized, student friendly hub. When a student logs in, they have a personalized dashboard showing them all their academic information in one place.

From the user-end perspective, Einstein simplifies the student experience with a unified home view of their critical academic information, convenient deadline tracking, centralized communication, and vital notifications.

## Scope

This would not be difficult for a small team of programmers to take on as we are all familiar with what users would want from this, and this is a very manageable project system wise as it would simply depend on basic skills in using MongoDB, flask/backend, and any frontend language/design. We just want to modernize an existing system, while combining vital functionalities and creating new ones where there are weaknesses. Einstein will not attempt to replace financial service tools or housing platforms NYU uses, but focus solely on academic-related platforms.
